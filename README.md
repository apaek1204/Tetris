Paradigms final project by Andrew Paek (apaek1) and Ashley Cummins (acummins)

The goal of this project was to create a multiplayer game created through pygame and connect with twisted.

This is a recreation of the Tetris Game. The way you play the game is by using the arrow keys. Left will move the object left. Right will move the object right. Down move the object down. You can rotate the object clockwise by pressing 'C'. As the levels increase, the base speed at which the object falls increases. The level increases every time you break 10 rows. Every time you break a row, you increase your score. The more rows broken at once, the more points you will receive. There are 3 game modes, casual, speed-run, and competitive. In casual your goal is to outlast and outscore your opponent. In speed-run, you try to reach level 10 first. And in competitive, every time you increase in level, you can send an incomplete line to the opponent to try to disrupt them. The game is over if a win-condition is met or if you reach the top row of the board, which results in a game-over.
